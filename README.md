# ChatGPTArchiver

**ChatGPTArchiver** is a powerful Chrome extension that allows you to archive your ChatGPT conversations in multiple formats, including PDF, PNG, Markdown, JSON, HTML, and plain text. It supports both single-chat archiving and **batch archiving** of multiple conversations. This project has been re-engineered for Manifest V3 compliance and enhanced features, building upon the excellent work of `pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter`.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Multiple Formats:** Archive to PDF, PNG, Markdown, JSON, HTML, or Text.
-   **Batch Archiving:** Select multiple conversations from the sidebar and archive them all at once.
-   **High Fidelity:** Preserves code blocks, formatting, and timestamps.
-   **Privacy First:** Runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## ✨ Inspired By

This project is inspired by and builds upon the foundational work of [chatgpt-exporter](https://github.com/pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter) by pionxzh. We thank the original creator for their valuable contribution to the community.
