    *   *Right-click* the zip file and select **"Extract All..."** or **"Unzip"**.
    *   Remember where you saved this folder (e.g., your "Downloads" or "Documents" folder).

### 2. Open Chrome Extensions Settings

### 3. Enable "Developer Mode"
*Don't worry, this is safe! It simply allows you to install internal company tools.*

2.  Find the switch labeled **"Developer mode"**.
3.  Click it to toggle it **ON** (the switch usually turns blue).

2.  A file browser window will open.
3.  Navigate to the **folder you unzipped** in Step 1.
